## Rust Playground

just a personal rust <> browser wasm playground.

#### try a wasm example
```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# move to example directory
cd ./hello-world

# if the package has js dependencies 
# (will warn you that nodejs packages are missing)
# npm install

npm run build
npm start

# wasm bundle now serves at localhost:8080
```
